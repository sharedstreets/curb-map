## Install

In the working copy:

1. Set up project and install dependencies:
```sh
yarn
```

2. Restore Ant Design Pro (charting library) styling changes:
```sh
git checkout node_modules/ant-design-pro
```
(This is necessary because installing the dependencies removed chart styling overrides.)

3. Launch map:
```sh
yarn start
```

## Configure
